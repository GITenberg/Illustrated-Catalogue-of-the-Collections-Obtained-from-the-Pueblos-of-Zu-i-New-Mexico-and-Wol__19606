<i>Washington, D.C., August 28, 1882.</i></p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Sir</span>: I have the honor to present
herewith an illustrated catalogue of archaeologic and ethnologic
collections, made under your direction in Arizona and New Mexico, during
the field season of 1881.</p>

<p>In connection with these collections, I am indebted to Mr.
Frank&nbsp;H. Cushing for the preparation of the field catalogue for the
collection from Zuñi. His thorough knowledge of the Zuñi language
enabled him to obtain the Indian name of most of the articles procured,
which names are given in this catalogue. I have also to thank him for
valuable assistance in making the collection. I also take pleasure in
expressing thanks to Mr. Victor Mindeleff for his aid in making the
collection, in which labor he rendered faithful assistance.</p>

<p>Col. L. P. Bradley, commandant of Fort Wingate, extended us many
courtesies and material aid, for which I am pleased to extend
thanks.</p>

<p>Hoping the collections of the season form a contribution equally
valuable with those previously procured from the southwest,</p>

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

ILLUSTRATED CATALOGUE<br>
OF THE COLLECTIONS OF 1881.</h3>

<hr class = "tiny">

<h4 class = "smallcaps">By James Stevenson.</h4>

<hr class = "tiny">

<h4><a name = "intro" id = "intro">INTRODUCTORY.</a></h4>

<p>The following catalogue contains a descriptive enumeration of the
archaeologic and ethnologic specimens collected in Arizona and New
Mexico during the season of 1881. These collections were all obtained
from the pueblo of Zuñi in Northwestern New Mexico, and the pueblos
comprising the province of Tusayan, in Northeastern Arizona. The entire
collection contains about four thousand nine hundred specimens.</p>

<p>The articles of stone consist of axes, in various conditions of
preservation. Some are quite perfect, while many are more or less
impaired by modern uses, for which they were not originally intended. In
nearly all instances they are grooved, and a few are provided with
double splitting or cutting edges; but as a rule these axes were made
with one end blunt for pounding or hammering, while the opposite end is
provided with an edge. The large pestles and mortars were designed for
crushing grain and food, the small ones for grinding and mixing mineral
pigments for ceramic or decorative purposes.</p>

<p>Among the articles of stone are about one hundred and fifty hunting
and war amulets. These objects present the most interesting features of
the collection, and were among the most difficult articles to obtain.
The Indians prize them very highly as keepsakes, which they employ in
war, the chase, and sacred ceremonies. Each specimen is specifically
referred to in the catalogue, accompanied with some wood-cut
illustrations of such specimens as possess the greatest
significance.</p>

<p>Mr. Frank H. Cushing has presented a full account of the history,
traditions, and uses of these images or gods, in a paper entitled “Zuñi
Fetiches,” in the Second Annual Report of the Bureau for 1882, to which
the reader is referred.</p>

<p>In these collections, as in those of the two previous seasons,
articles of clay predominate. They consist of Tinajas, or large,
decorated, vase-shaped water-vessels. These vary in capacity from one to
six gallons, and are the principal vessels used for holding and storing
water for domestic purposes. These vases do not vary greatly in form,
yet the colored designs with which they are ornamented present as many
variations as there are specimens. The causes for these variations, both
in size and ceramic characters, as well as the method of manufacturing
them, are quite fully explained in the notes accompanying my catalogue
of collections from these same localities in the Annual Report of the
Bureau of Ethnology for 1880-’81.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">520</span>
<a name = "page520" id = "page520"> </a>
<!--png 668-->

<p>The collection also contains a large number of jug-shaped canteens,
varying in capacity from one pint to three gallons. These vessels, like
an ordinary jug, are provided with a small nozzle, and are used to carry
water and to drink from. They vary in their decorative designs, but are
seldom as elaborate or beautiful as the vases.</p>

<p>In the collection are also clay spoons, ladles, and dippers of two or
three kinds of ware, such as red, white, and black, of various sizes.
Many of these are fancifully decorated. Also pitchers, mugs, and cups of
different patterns, forms, and sizes, variously ornamented in red,
black, and white. A very fine collection of meal or sacred pottery
baskets was obtained. These are also of varied forms or types, some with
handles, terraced and fluted edges or rims, usually decorated with
figures of the tadpole and horned frog, and occasionally with the
representation of the road runner, and frequently with the sacred
butterfly.</p>

<p>The condiment vessels form no small part of the collection. The forms
and styles of these vessels can only be appreciated by reference to the
specific descriptions and illustrations in the catalogue.</p>

<p>A large number of cooking bowls and pots were obtained, but these are
of less interest, as they are in all cases plain black vessels without
ornamentation of any kind. They generally resemble the old-fashioned
cast-iron cooking pot used by Europeans. Occasionally one is found which
is provided with legs, in imitation probably of the skillet or pots used
by the Mexicans of that country.</p>

<p>The vegetal substances comprise utensils and implements of all kinds.
Among these are baskets, trays, water-jugs, corn-planters, bows, arrows,
sieves, gaming-blocks, &amp;c. The basketry is worthy of inspection for
the ingenuity and skill displayed in the manufacture of such articles.
These consist of fine meal baskets or trays of all sizes, many of which
are curiously ornamented in bright colors. The coarser baskets, which
are constructed and shaped to suit the service for which they are
employed, are used as sieves and for conveying corn and fruit from the
farms. In addition to the objects above referred to, hundreds that are

Technical Note on Zuni words</a></h4>

<p>The system of transliteration is not explained in the text. It was
therefore difficult, often impossible, to distinguish typograpical
errors from variant forms or imperfect transcription.</p>

<p>The sound rendered as “thl” would be written today as ł (l&nbsp;with
crossing line). The backward apostrophe ‘ probably represents the
glottal stop; the simple apostrophe ’ may indicate the same sound. The
two characters seem to occur in complementary distribution (initial vs.
non-initial syllables), but exceptions were too numerous to list. The
free-standing accent ´ may be a stress marker. Small raised g could not
be identified.</p>

<p>The spelling “Zuñi” with tilde is Spanish; today the word is
generally
written “Zuni.”</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
